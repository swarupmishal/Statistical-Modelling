## What exactly the Data is?
Its a large dataset with 10000 records of a list of customers of a Bank. Bank is recently facing a problem that a lot of its customers are leaving the Bank. The dataset contains details like CustomerID, CreditScore, Geography, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumberOfProducts, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary and if the customer has excited the bank or not. We are trying to analyze what type of customers are most likely to leave the Bank.

## How have we tackled the problem?
We have built a complete robust Geodemographic Segmentation Model for Churn Investigation of a Bank dataset. Preprocessed the data using Excel, SSIS and SSMS. Also we have applied Logistic Regression using backward elimination, transformed independent variables, created derived variables, checked for multicollinearity in Gretl, drew Cumulative Accuracy Profile curve for the model in Excel. Applied the model on the test data with a reduction in accuracy of only 3%.
